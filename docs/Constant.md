# Application Constant

This is collection of constant and options that can be use all over application so all application could have same constant value, from status, to some of simple application options like list of "Term of Payment".

## Installation

Because this is only trait, you could just simply use the trait inside your class, e.g :

```php

// Include trait from package
use Tiny\Traits\ConstTraits;

class YourClass extends \Some\Other\Class
{
    use ConstTraits;

    ...
}

```
